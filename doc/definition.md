# TokenScript short definition: 
TokenScript is the standard markup language for creating and using cryptographic tokens(e.g. blockchain tokens) and DApps. It is a standard to abstract out the token information, access methods and UI rendering so that the tokens can be efficiently marketised and used for integration.


# TokenScript Short introduction: 

Today, the way tokens are accessed, rendered and transacted are scattered across Dapps and Smart Contracts. If all knowledge about a token is in a DApp, the DApp has to participate in the marketization and all integrations of that token, recreating data interoperability, security and availability barrier - exactly the same set of issues that prevented tokenisation before blockchain was invented. 

TokenScript is a standard markup language for creating and using cryptographic tokens(e.g. blockchain tokens) and DApps. It is a standard to abstract out the token information, access methods and UI rendering so that the tokens can be efficiently marketised and used for integration.

It allows different token providers to, not only describe the features of their tokens but also how they are allowed to “act”, e.g. transferability. The crux of the idea is that such a markup description can be updated at any time by the token issuer and retroactively reflect the behaviour of already issued tokens. Besides allowing easy interoperability between different token providers, this also eliminates the need to update the DApp or smart contract whenever the business logic of a particular type of token changes.


# TokenScript Project introduction: 

TokenScript Project is an opensource and NFP project, the goal to develop and help with adoption of TokenScript, the standard markup language for creating and using cryptographic tokens(e.g. blockchain tokens) and DApps.

The remarkable blockchain speculations that took place in 2017 - 2018 brought everyone's attention to crypto tokens. As we bought and sold them, we forgot their intended purpose was to be used; this is analogous to the housing bubble in which people forgot that houses were not merely speculative assets but rather a place to live. To provide a practical use of the blockchain, we must understand its utility to the world economy and the internet. The people behind this project are technical experts who went through years of study and experimentation into its applications both via financial institutions and startups. With this experience, we recognise the blockchain technology's utility in providing a frictionless market and integrating the web.

Despite the great folly in 2017-2018, it is not a bad thing to initially focus on tokens. Tokens are the enabler of the two primary functions. We define the technique to make it happen in "Tokenisation". Tokenized rights can be traded on the market and integrated across systems, forming a frictionless market and allowing free integration. Previous efforts in this industry primarily focused on enriching the capacity of the technology. This project will focus on tokenisation and introduce a standardisation effort known as Tokenscript (Token Behaviour Markup Language) which will make the blockchain technical stack complete, providing utility for the economy and the internet.
